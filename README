autocount is my laziness embodied.
we started this research project thinking to count EVERY UPDATE given by select political causes on tw, fb, and email.
Unfortunately for us, and fortunately for this project, it proved to be FAR too much to count each status by hand.
Much less, to categorize each and get a wordcount. Folly! I would say. Or madness!

So yeah. Here we need to...
Use apis to access tw and fb (and maybe email) via python
Enumerate posts for three accounts:
	-for each account
	-for each day
	-for each interest
		-get number of tweets
		-each one's word count
		-categorize into: event, awareness, money, or noise
	-write the above to a database
	-make some cool queries that display the data from db to...screen? website? charts? idk...

Steps:
	-investigate guhmail api and implement if doable
	-get/download twitter api examples w/py (repeat for fb after done)
	-craft the above scipt to enumerate 
	-once you can reliably get the data, design db table to store it
	-decide on a presentation method and implement.

-???
-TAKE.OVER.THE.WORLD

TODO
	-create logins template once structure is finalized
	-make main.py run the three checks in parallel.
	-make main.py more general
	-combine the separate credential files into one
